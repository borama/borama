### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is **MatouÅ¡ BorÃ¡k**. Iâ€™m a Ruby on Rails developer, currently CTO at NejÅ˜emeslnÃ­ci (a company building a portal for connecting local craftspeople with their customers). I mostly work on the product, think of code quality, try to enhance our dev processes, review the code of our small dev team (~ 5 people).

Also I like to write about tech-related stuff, here are a few of my recent articles:

- [Bitwarden: use the most convenient 2FA while staying reasonably safe](https://dev.to/borama/bitwarden-use-the-most-convenient-2fa-while-staying-reasonably-safe-13ee) - I gladly use this feature but think about risks
- [A few sneak peeks into Hey.com technology](https://dev.to/borama/a-few-sneak-peeks-into-hey-com-technology-i-intro-4bjg) - a 7-parts article about the new exciting stuff that I found in hey.com when it was released
- [Archiving large MySQL tables](https://dev.to/nejremeslnici/archiving-large-mysql-tables-part-i-intro-4im1) - a 3-parts article about how to get the largest but least important data off your database
- [How old are dependencies in your (ruby) project?](https://dev.to/nejremeslnici/how-old-are-dependencies-in-your-ruby-project-3jia) - a way to visualize the recency of the gems in your project
- [Migrating from jquery-ujs to rails-ujs](https://dev.to/nejremeslnici/migrating-from-jquery-ujs-to-rails-ujs-k9m) - some hardcore tech stuff
