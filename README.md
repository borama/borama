### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is **MatouÅ¡ BorÃ¡k**. Iâ€™m a Ruby on Rails developer, currently a CTO at [NejÅ˜emeslnÃ­ci.cz](https://www.nejremeslnici.cz) (a company building a portal for connecting local craftspeople with their customers, now part of [Saint-Gobain](https://www.saint-gobain.com/en)). I mostly work on the product, think of code quality, try to enhance our dev processes in our small dev team (~ 5 people), present what we do to the rest of the company, review the code and take care of the infrastructure.

Also I like to write about tech-related stuff, here are a few of my selected articles:
